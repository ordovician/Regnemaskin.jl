# Simulation of Early Computing Machines
The motivation for this package is to contain various algorithms and code examples which demonstrate or simulate how very early computers such as:

- Abacus
- Arithmometer mechanical calculator
- The Difference Engine and Analytical Engine
- The Z1 to Z4 computers by Konrad Zuse

The focus is on explaining how basic calculations such as addition, subtraction, division and multiplication was implemente. In addition we will look at what sort of mathematical problems early computer solved.

The intention is also to show what makes a computer different from a calculator.

## What does "Regnemaskin" mean?
"Regnemaskin" is Norwegian for calculating machine. The motivation for the name is simply to avoid name collisions given how many packages use simple english names.
